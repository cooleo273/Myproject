                    TIle design and study of electric machines and power systems are among the oldest areas of electrical 
                    engineering. Study began in the latter part of the nineteenth
                    century. At that time, electrical units were being standardized internationally, and
                    these units came to be universally used by engineers. Volts, amperes, ohms, watts,
                    and similar units, which are part of the metric system of units, have long been
                    used to describe electrical quantities in machines.
                    In English-speaking countries, though, mechanical quantities had long been
                    measured with the English system of units (inches, feet, pounds, etc.). This 
                    practice was followed in the study of machines. TIlerefore, for many years the electrical 
                    and mechanical quantities of machines have been measured with different systems of units.
